    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tasty and simple, hands off pressure cooker soup made from lentils and tomatoes</p>
    <p>This lentil tomato soup, inspired by Joan of Arc's journey through the South, captures the essence of simplicity and nourishment, much like the meals she might have encountered along the way. Lentils serve as the hearty base of this dish, representing a staple in Mediterranean and Southern French diets. Known for their high protein content and earthy flavor, lentils symbolize the strength and sustenance that were vital to Joan's mission. Their ability to absorb flavors makes them an ideal ingredient for a rich, flavorful soup that warms and comforts, much like the hospitality Joan would have experienced in the homes she visited.</p>
<p>Canned chopped tomatoes add a vibrant and tangy element to the soup, reflecting the sun-kissed landscapes of Southern France. Tomatoes are a key ingredient in many regional dishes, offering a burst of acidity and sweetness that balances the earthiness of the lentils. The use of canned tomatoes ensures a consistent, ripe flavor, making the soup accessible and easy to prepare year-round. This ingredient not only enhances the color and taste of the soup but also symbolizes the bountiful harvests and agricultural richness of the regions Joan traversed.</p>
<p>The sofrito ingredients—typically a blend of onions, bell peppers, garlic, and sometimes tomatoes—are essential for building the soup's base flavor. Sofrito is a foundational element in Mediterranean and Latin cuisines, used to add depth and complexity. The combination of these vegetables sautéed in olive oil provides a sweet, savory foundation that permeates the entire dish. This blend mirrors the diverse cultural influences Joan encountered, blending different elements into a cohesive and harmonious flavor profile. The sofrito not only enhances the soup's taste but also represents the rich culinary traditions of the South.</p>
<p>Onions, as a key component of the sofrito, bring sweetness and a subtle sharpness, enhancing the soup's overall flavor. Bell peppers add a slight sweetness and a pop of color, contributing to the visual appeal of the dish. Garlic provides a pungent, aromatic quality that deepens the flavor, while tomatoes add an additional layer of acidity and brightness. This combination of vegetables creates a well-rounded base that complements the lentils and tomatoes, resulting in a soup that is both hearty and flavorful.</p>
<p>In preparing the soup, the lentils are first cooked until tender, absorbing the flavors of the sofrito and tomatoes. The canned chopped tomatoes are added to create a rich, tomatoey broth that envelops the lentils. The sofrito is sautéed separately, allowing the vegetables to release their natural sugars and deepen their flavors before being incorporated into the soup. This method ensures that each ingredient contributes its unique characteristics to the final dish, creating a balanced and harmonious blend of flavors.</p>
<p>This lentil tomato soup is more than just a comforting meal; it is a culinary tribute to Joan of Arc's journey and the diverse cultural influences she encountered. The combination of lentils, tomatoes, and sofrito ingredients creates a dish that is both nourishing and deeply satisfying. The flavors are layered and complex, reflecting the rich history and traditions of the regions Joan traveled through. This soup serves as a warm and comforting reminder of the resilience and strength that defined Joan's journey.</p>
<p>In summary, this lentil tomato soup celebrates the simplicity and richness of Southern French and Mediterranean cuisine, inspired by the legacy of Joan of Arc. The use of lentils and tomatoes as core ingredients honors the agricultural bounty of the South, while the sofrito adds depth and complexity, representing the diverse cultural influences Joan encountered. This dish is a heartfelt homage to her enduring spirit, offering a taste of history through its warm and inviting flavors.</p>
