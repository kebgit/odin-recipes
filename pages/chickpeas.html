    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Air fried chickpeas with lemon or lime and oil drizzle</p>
    <p>This simple chickpea recipe draws inspiration from Joan of Arc's voyage through the South, a journey characterized by resilience and discovery. The choice of chickpeas as the primary ingredient reflects the hearty and wholesome nature of the legume, which is a staple in Mediterranean diets. Chickpeas, with their rich protein content and satisfying texture, symbolize the sustenance and strength Joan needed during her travels. This dish uses chickpeas as a base, providing a nutritious and filling component that is both versatile and beloved in Southern French cuisine.</p>
<p>Toasted sesame oil is used to enhance the flavor of the chickpeas, adding a subtle nutty aroma that complements the legume's earthy tones. This ingredient brings a hint of the East, highlighting the diverse cultural influences Joan might have encountered in her travels. The use of toasted sesame oil also adds a luxurious, silky texture to the dish, elevating its simplicity and echoing the richness of Southern French culinary traditions. The oil's warm, toasty flavor serves as a nod to the warmth and hospitality of the regions Joan traversed.</p>
<p>The inclusion of lime or lemon juice introduces a bright and zesty element, essential for balancing the dish's flavors. The citrus notes provide a refreshing contrast to the rich, nutty taste of the toasted sesame oil and the creamy texture of the chickpeas. This acidity not only enhances the overall taste but also symbolizes the clarity and purity of Joan's vision. The choice between lime and lemon allows for a personal touch, offering a slight variation in flavor that can cater to different preferences, much like the diverse experiences Joan encountered during her journey.</p>
<p>Salt is a fundamental ingredient in this recipe, used to season the chickpeas and bring out the natural flavors of the other components. A pinch of salt elevates the dish, adding depth and enhancing the chickpeas' inherent nuttiness. In a historical context, salt was a valuable commodity, often used for preservation and seasoning, symbolizing its essential role in both culinary practices and daily life. In this recipe, salt serves as a reminder of the basic yet indispensable elements of Southern French cuisine, mirroring Joan's own grounding presence in the complex political and cultural landscape of her time.</p>
<p>Combining these ingredients, the recipe creates a dish that is both simple and deeply flavorful, much like the straightforward yet profound impact of Joan of Arc's journey. The toasted sesame oil and chickpeas provide a rich, satisfying base, while the lime or lemon juice adds a refreshing zing, and the salt ties all the flavors together. This harmonious blend reflects the diverse influences and experiences Joan encountered, as well as the simple yet profound nature of her mission.</p>
<p>In terms of preparation, the recipe is straightforward, emphasizing the natural flavors of the ingredients.
